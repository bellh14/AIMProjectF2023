- **What data do you want to collect?**  
Data on company bankruptcy and employee attrition.
- **Why do you want that data?**  
This data seems useful because not going bankrupt is a very good goal to have as a company, the farther away you are from bankrupt the better off you will be generally. Employee attrition seems useful because the fewer employees you have leaving the company means that more resources can be spent on doing work instead of training new employees.
- **How do you intend to obtain that data?**  
Kaggle seems to be a really good source for datasets, although the quality is not necessarily perfect. However since this project is mainly a proof of concept the data should be fine.
